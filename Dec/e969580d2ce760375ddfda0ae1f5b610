Passengers who have flown in to South Africa&#8217;s largest airport have been furious over the long waiting periods trying to enter the country with the service booths being severely understaffed.Traveller24 reported earlier that a two-hour wait in an immigration queue at OR Tambo International, that was four lines deep and only being attended to by four immigration officials, cost one US traveller R15,000 to buy an air ticket after she missed her connecting flight.Malusi Gigaba, Minister of Home Affairs has finally announced that all workstations would be functioning at 100% capacity, with all cubicles utilised to process passengers.The additional staff will be incorporated into a new structure of two shifts a day, which will overlap the shifts of current staff during peak periods. The first shift runs from 06h00 until 11h00, and the second shift from 16h00 until 20h00. The increased service will be in place up to 14 January.Gigaba has stressed that this is a temporary solution and has stated that &#8220;We will require a sustainable solution that appreciates that efficiency, through the optimal staff capacity, needs to extend beyond the festive season.&#8221;Source: SAPromo
