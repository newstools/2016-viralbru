John Block, the former ANC Northern Cape chairperson and finance MEC, as well as his &#8216;business partner&#8217; Christo Scholtz, have been sentenced to 15 years in prison on corruption charges.Block and Scholtz were found guilty of money laundering and corruption by the Northern Cape High Court on Tuesday. They were reportedly involved in a scheme whereby they charged higher than market prices for leasing buildings to the government, of which Block was head of finance. Hmm seems a little suspicious.The court has also subsequently ruled in favour of the NPA&#8217;s Asset Forfeiture Unit to lay claim to Trifecta Property.The NPA s Phaladi Shuping says, The money that is involved, which will be confiscated from the group of companies that s owned by Scholtz, is R60 million. So that money will be paid back to the National Treasury. Shuping says the Treasury allocated funds to Social Development which was defrauded. The offences relate to the leasing of government offices for Social Department in the Northern Cape on which one company was granted the lease agreement without proper procedures being followed. Shuping says, Mr John Block was sentenced to 15 years for corruption, and he also got 12 years for money laundering. The judge ordered the sentences to run concurrently. From the day that they were convicted, all we were asking for as the NPA was the minimum sentence as prescribed in the law, which is 15 years for corruption and we are satisfied because we got exactly what we were looking for.
