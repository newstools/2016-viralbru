South Africa has started a trial using the only vaccine proven to offer some protection from HIV.The vaccine is a modified version of a Thai vaccine that offered 31% protection to those vaccinated.Volunteers have to have HIV and pregnancy tests as well as other lab tests, before they can be enrolled. Once a volunteer has proven they are HIV negative and aren&#8217;t pregnant they can be enrolled for the vaccine. They need to have five vaccinations over the course of a year, and three years after enrolling they are tested for HIV.Source: Health24
