The Chief of Staff who served under Thuli Madonsela, was marched out of the office of the public protector under the claims that he was a threat to Busisiwe Mkhwebane&#8217;s security.The Chief of Staff, Bonginkosi Dhlamini, told Huffington Post South Africa that the incident took place on Wednesday.&#8220;The new public protector sent her bouncers, the so-called VIP protectors, to say I shouldn&#8217;t be there because my presence is interfering with her security,&#8221; said Dhlamini.This is the latest in a string of concerning changes in the office of the public protector.Busi Jele, who was the personal assistant to Thuli Madonsela, is also set to be replaced, as well as the only senior investigator who worked on the state capture report.Busisiwe Mkhwebane has made a large amount of fairly suspect decisions in her short time in office. Maybe she&#8217;s building up her CV to apply to join Zuma&#8217;s circle of cronies.Source: Huffington Post
