Unisa has named former president Thabo Mbeki as its new chancellor, as it aims to re-establish itself as an African University. Professor Mandla Makhanya said that in making the decision there had been consensus that Mbeki was &#8221; an outstanding African intelleectual giant and the most recognisable 21st century proponent of the African Renaissance who is highly regarded internationally.&#8221;Mbeki&#8217;s role in the anti-apartheid liberation striggle and post-apartheid nation-building have also been acknowledged by the institution. As well as his current role in conflict-resolution and development initiatives on the continent.&#8220;We have observed his consistency, passion and dedication in the educational and intellectual engagement programmes. This is in line with and helps to reinforce our academic and research project,&#8221; &#8211; MakhanyaFurthermore, Unisa aims to become an intellectual home of African thought and leadership and that Mbeki&#8217;s appointment would give impetus to the institution&#8217;s partnership with the African Union.Mbeki takes over from Judge Bernard Ngoepe who stepped down earlier this week.Source: News24&nbsp;
