Hlaudi! Hlaudi Hlaudi Hlaudi, he never fails to do something ridiculous.Mr Motsoeneng&#8217;s latest antics are on another level.The chief instigator decided to delay the broadcast of Morning Live&#8217;s 7 am news bulletin by a whole seven minutes. For one reason, to let a Lesotho group sing him a song in his honour.Rumour has it SABC staff said were scared to pull the plug on the song on Tuesday morning because they feared being fired if they did.The lyrics include Leave him (Hlaudi Motsoeneng) alone. Hlaudi wants African music to grow. We thank God for Hlaudi Motsoeneng. May God protect him for us. We love him.
