Zuma has made a lot of claims lately, at an ANC Youth League&#8217;s economic freedom lecture at the Durban City hall on Sunday night he spent the night bragging about what he&#8217;s accomplished over the years.Firstly he starts off by calling himself a political genius who liberated the country and founded the ANC political school on Robben Island. Next up is how he went against the late prominent SA Communist Party leader, Harry Gwala who was opposed to peaceful negotiations.He continued to brag about how he managed to reduce the IFP support into a tiny margin in a province that it once regarded it&#8217;s stronghold. I was taking away what the IFP had been using to control the province. Before, when you do traditional dance you would be seen as IFP person. Where is the IFP today? It is so tiny,&#8221; said Zuma.He characterised himself as a genius of politics as he also taught it on Robben Island where he served 10 years for fighting the oppressive apartheid regime. It (ANC s political education) was formed by five people: Riot Mkhwanazi, Alfred Duma, Sazi Ngcongo, Msizeni Shadrack Maphumulo and Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma. It is how it started for the Robben Island to be a political school. It is because we knew that it was important to know politics, the president said.He continued on to speak about how Gwala used to mock him for his peaceful efforts and said &#8220;I only wanted to protect ANC people from killing each other. I would just say, this one (Gwala) has time to play , which I did not have. I am liberating this country, Zuma has also said that he wants to be mayor of hometown Nkandla, currently run by the IFP, when his term as president ends in 2019. Saying that the people of Nkandla would for him and the ANC would takeover.Let us know what you think of Zuma&#8217;s idea of himself as a &#8220;genius&#8221;Source: IOLDon&#8217;t forget to Like and share on Facebook!
