Looks like the Education department is fixing South Africa&#8217;s mathematics fail rate, by letting you pass as long as you know that 2 + 2 is in fact a maths sum. The answer? What? That&#8217;s not important man, don&#8217;t be ridiculous.Brian Schreuder, head of the Western Cape Education Department, has confirmed that 20% is indeed the new mathematics pass rate. When a learner, specifically those in Grades 7 to 9, has failed mathematics it means they can t be promoted to another level because mathematics is a compulsory pass subject, A directive has been issued for those learners who pass everything but fail mathematics to be considered for the new pass requirement so they can continue to FETs or Grade 10.&nbsp;Source: mybroadband.co.za
