Our boy JZ had to stop halfway through his Day of Reconciliation speech, when the marquee&#8217;s he was in collapsed due to a fierce storm in Gopane, North West, on Friday.The tempest saw all news broadcasts cut short and people stampeding in terror after the top of the marquee was torn off by the winds.Zuma&#8217;s speech was recieved well by the crowd, while he spoke of the country&#8217;s history and the holidays. When Zuma mentioned the Marikana incident the tent collapsed. JZ was towed away by his bodyguards and left the community.
