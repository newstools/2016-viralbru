Faith Muthambi&#8217;s testimony to the parliamentary committee that investigated the SABC board was rife with dishonesty, and has been contradicted by the evidence presented from other witnessesHer biggest lie: Her denial that she had stripped the SABC board of its power to appoint chief executives.The only way she could have done that is to amend the SABC&#8217;s memorandum of incorporation, which according to her she did not do.She claimed it was done before she became Minister of Communications in 2014 and that she only corrected spelling and grammatical errors.Rachel Kalidass, a chartered accountant who was allegedly fired from the SABC board for opposing Hlaudi Motsoeneng&#8217;s appointment, has brought forward proof that contradicts these claims.An email dated 29 November 2014 from the SABC secretary notified all board members that Muthambi had amended the memorandum of incorporation.The amendments made gave authority to appoint executives to the group CEO, COO, and CFO.Muthambi has also said that it&#8217;s parliament&#8217;s fault for poor appointments to the SABC board.Source: MyBroadband&nbsp;&nbsp;
