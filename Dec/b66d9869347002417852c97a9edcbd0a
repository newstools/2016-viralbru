Details of an alleged secret meeting where the murder of the country&#8217;s political bosses was plotted, intending to spark an Arab Spring-style uprising resulting in the downfall of the president, have been revealed by General Prince Mokotedi of the HAWKS.Independent Police Investigative Directorate head Robert McBride, former Hawks boss Shadrack Sibiya, private investigator Paul O&#8217;Sullivan and crime intelligence officer Candice Coetzee have been accused of conspiracy to commit murder, treason, espionage and several other crimes by Mokotedy.General Mokotedi alleges that earlier in December, the four individuals held a braai at Radovan Krejcir s former house in Bedfordview, which is now owned by O Sullivan, and identified individuals for vexatious criminal investigations and shaming in the media.These people were targeted for their support of President Zuma.It was apparently resolved that O Sullivan would dig up dirt on the individuals as well as on the president s son Duduzane Zuma and this information would be used to mobilize an Arab Spring-type revolt in the country.A separate meeting was then held at the Michaelangelo Hotel in March with Serbian nationals and Zimbabwean intelligence officials as the plot was apparently hatched to assassinate Mokotedi and Ntlemeza.
