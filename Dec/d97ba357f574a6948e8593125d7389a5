So earlier this year, in June, SA&#8217;s top cop made news country-wide when it was reported that he fought off multiple robbers at the Ayothaya spa in Dunkeld.However video footage posted by News24 shows something a little different.The initial report stated that Phahlane fought off the robbers and chased them, and although the video does show him putting up a fight, he ends up diving behind a couch when the robbers return.Before you form your opinions, the lack of audio in the video does make it difficult to get the full scope of events, but what it looks like is after fighting them they then return with the intent of shooting the commissioner, who took cover behind the couch. Presumably to avoid being shot. While many reports state that he was being cowardly, we don&#8217;t see it as such. Good job Commissioner Pahlane, things would have gone very differently without you there. Source: News24
